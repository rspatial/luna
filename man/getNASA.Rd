Find and download NASA data for a specific product, area, and time period. The function returned is list of filenames that may have been downloaded.

It is important to fist consult \code{\link{getProducts}} to discover what products and version numbers are available, and which server to use.
}

\usage{
getNASA(product, start_date, end_date, aoi, version=NULL, download=FALSE, path, 
	username, password, server="LPDAAC_ECS", limit=100000, overwrite=FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{product}{character. Supported products can be found using \code{\link{getProducts}}}
  \item{start_date}{character. Start date for the data requested formatted yyyy-m-d}
  \item{end_date}{Character. end date for the data requested formatted yyyy-m-d}
  \item{aoi}{numeric vector of four elements (minimum longitude, maximum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum latitude) encompassing the area of interest. It can also be a SpatExtent, or any object from which an extent can be extracted}
  \item{version}{character. product version number}
  \item{download}{logical. If \code{TRUE} data will be downloaded unless it is present in the download directory}
  \item{path}{character. Path name indicating where to store the data}
  \item{username}{character. EOSDIS user name (see Details)}
  \item{password}{character. EOSDIS password (see Details)}
  \item{server}{character. The server to download the data from}
  \item{limit}{positive integer}
  \item{overwrite}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, existing files are overwritten}
  \item{...}{Additional arguments. These can be product specific. See Details)}
}


\value{
Character vector of file names pointing to the downloaded files (if \code{download=TRUE})
}

\details{
This function is an R interface to the EOSDIS system. Access is free, but it requires a "Earthdata" account. If you do not have an account, you can sign up here: \url{https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new}

If no data is available between \code{start_date} and \code{end_date}, files for the closest dates are returned.
